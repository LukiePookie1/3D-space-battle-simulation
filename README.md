# Simple 3D Spaceship Battle Simulation with ASCII Graphics
A simple Python simulation where two ships move in 3D space and try to destroy each other based on angle and distance checks. This project uses an ASCII-based view of their positions on the x-y plane each time step.

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy
```
## Run
```bash
